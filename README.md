# Aurora
A simple yet powerful entertainment solution for Discord servers of any size. Previously was just a private bot for my own Discord server, [Adwaita](https://discord.gg/ctKs8WRQR5).

## Why this repo is called Aurora and not Tiramisu?
That's because we still primarily develop this bot for Adwaita, and Aurora is the name of our private instance. It is also a reference to one of the oldest members of our server.

## Contributing
We strive to provide a quality product; however, nothing is ideal in this world. If you find any bugs or encounter issues, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/chamln/aurora/issues/new). If you found an issue and know how to fix it, or you have implemented a new feature, don't hesitate to [open a pull request](https://github.com/chamln/aurora/pulls) - we'll do our best to quickly review and merge your changes and inform you of problems, if any.

## Can I self-host Aurora?
Technically you can, but I would not recommend it for several reasons:
1. Self-hosting is not supported, and if you decide to do it, you won't get any help
2. The source code is provided here mainly for transparency of how the bot works
3. We don't have an installation manual, so you'll have to figure it out on your own
4. In most cases, a feature request will suffice to add new features to the bot

If you do want to run your own copy, please keep in mind that you:
1. Must comply with the [license](./LICENSE)
2. Cannot upload a copy to bot lists such as bots.gg or top.gg
